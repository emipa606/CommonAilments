# Compatibility
  *** Subject to conversion ***

The following mods in addition to vanilla have had their drugs patched to allow for best use with this mod:

Apothecary
Diseases Overhauled
Medical Supplements
Multiplayer Support
Orassons and Orrasons Lite (catnip).
RimCuisine 1.0
RimCuisine 2.0
Social Supplements

(And I will be happy to discuss with other mod authors how to add compatibility for the various ailments by associating their relevant drugs using "xpath" patching. I regularly use Rimworld discord).

Dubs hygiene - Increases synergy with illnesses and hygiene.
